**Repository for CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerScale**

## Description
CSI Driver for PowerScale is part of the [CSM (Container Storage Modules)](https://github.com/dell/csm) open-source suite of Kubernetes storage enablers for Dell EMC products. CSI Driver for PowerScale is a Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver that provides support for provisioning persistent storage using Dell EMC PowerScale storage array. 

It supports CSI specification version 1.4.

This project may be compiled as a stand-alone binary using Golang that, when run, provides a valid CSI endpoint. It also can be used as a precompiled container image.

## Support
For any CSI driver issues, questions or feedback, please follow our [support process](https://github.com/dell/csm/blob/main/docs/SUPPORT.md)

## Building
This project is a Go module (see golang.org Module information for explanation).
The dependencies for this project are in the go.mod file.

To build the source, execute `make clean build`.

To run unit tests, execute `make unit-test`.

To build a podman based image, execute `make podman-build`.

You can run an integration test on a Linux system by populating the env files at `test/integration/` with values for your Dell EMC PowerScale systems and then run "`make integration-test`".

## Runtime Dependencies
Both the Controller and the Node portions of the driver can only be run on nodes which have network connectivity to a “`PowerScale Cluster`” (which is used by the driver).
